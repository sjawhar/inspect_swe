    """Antigravity CLI agent.

    Agent that uses Google's [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/overview)
    (`agy`) running in a sandbox with Inspect model bridging.

    Model calls are bridged the same way `gemini_cli`'s are: the CLI's direct
    Gemini API route (`modelProvider: "gemini"`, added in `agy` 1.1.13) is
    selected and `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` is pointed at the loopback
    `sandbox_agent_bridge`, so generation never leaves the sandbox and no Google
    sign-in happens. `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set to a placeholder purely to satisfy
    the CLI's credential check -- the bridge does not read it.

    This is a different agent from `antigravity`, which runs the
    `google-antigravity` **SDK** rather than the shipped CLI.

    Use the `attempts` option to enable additional submissions if the initial
    submission(s) are incorrect (by default, no additional attempts are permitted).

    Args:
        name: Agent name (used in multi-agent systems with `as_tool()` and `handoff()`)
        description: Agent description
        system_prompt: Additional system prompt to append
        skills: Additional [skills](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/tools-standard.html#sec-skill) to make available to the agent.
        mcp_servers: MCP servers to make available to the agent
        bridged_tools: Host-side Inspect tools to expose to the agent via MCP
        mcp_ready_timeout: Seconds to wait for bridged MCP endpoints to serve
            tools before the agent launch errors.
        centaur: Run in 'centaur' mode, which makes the Antigravity CLI available to an Inspect `human_cli()` agent rather than running it unattended.
        attempts: Configure agent to make multiple attempts
        model: Model name to use for inspect bridge (defaults to main model for task)
        model_aliases: Optional mapping of model names to Model instances or model name strings.
            Allows using custom Model implementations (e.g. wrapped Agents) instead of standard models.
        agy_model: Model name to pass to the CLI. The actual model calls still go
            through the Inspect bridge; this selects the CLI's own client-side
            model configuration (context window, effort handling, tool schema).
        effort: Reasoning effort to pass to the CLI. Passed explicitly by default:
            the Gemini 3.6/3.7 Flash families that `agy` defaults to require it,
            and leaving it implicit would let the CLI's own default decide what
            an eval measured. Pass `None` for a model that rejects the flag.
        filter: Filter for intercepting bridged model requests
        retry_refusals: Should refusals be retried? (pass number of times to retry)
        cwd: Working directory to run the CLI within
        env: Environment variables to set for the CLI
        user: User to execute the CLI with
        sandbox: Optional sandbox environment name
        version: Version of the Antigravity CLI to use. One of:
            - "auto": Use any available version in sandbox, otherwise download latest
            - "sandbox": Use sandbox version (raises RuntimeError if not available)
            - "stable"/"latest": Download and use the latest version
            - "x.x.x": Download and use a specific version

    MCP tools are otherwise loaded LAZILY: the CLI declares one native

    bridged Inspect tool is never a tool the model can call by name. Listing a
